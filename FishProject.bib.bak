  Abstract                 = {The rapid biofouling of fish-cage netting in Tasmania, Australia, necessitates the frequent changing of nets for on-shore cleaning. To reduce the cost associated with this capital- and labour-intensive process, a prototype underwater net cleaner was designed and constructed for the Tasmanian Atlantic salmon industry. This study describes trials aimed to determine the efficacy of this prototype, and to identify areas for improvement. The reduction in open area of netting mesh due to fouling growth, together with subsequent increases in open area after cleaning, were monitored by image analysis of underwater photographs. The preferential removal of larger fouling species and the occurrence of resistant species were documented. The design of the cleaning head and displacement of netting away from the cleaner reduced the severity of scrubbing, limiting fouling removal. However, with increased contact between the brushes and netting the cleaner prevented significant fouling development over a 10-week period. Scanning electron microscopy was used to identify the extent of residual fouling after cleaning, and the difficulty of removing fouling from crevices in the netting surface and from the sides of netting bars. The system can be highly effective, but the current design for presentation of the brushes greatly limits cleaning efficacy. The research has identified areas for design improvement, the problems associated with residual fouling and regrowth and the requirements for effective in situ net cleaning.},

  Review                   = {Summary
The nets of fish farms suffer greatly from biofouling as a consequence of the high level of nutrients in the waters of fish farms, from feed wastage and fish excretion. It is difficult and expensive to regularly change and clean the nets due to it being labour and capital-intensive, the damage caused to and loss of fish stock and the disturbance of the feeding regime leading to slower growth rates. One contemplated option has been to use toxic antifoulants on the nets, but there are concerns that these have a negative impact on the environment and they are ineffective against drifting algae. This paper describes trials conducted to test the effectiveness of a prototype in situ net cleaner for the Tasmanian Atlantic Salmon industry.
The proposed cleaner comprised of four pairs of rotating brushes which would move along the cage handrails. To determine the effectiveness of the cleaner the sample locations would be photographed and the amount of high contrast background visible would be compared to see how much of the mesh blockage remained. There were four different trials running;
how effective the cleaner was at fouling removal and the speed of regrowth,
residual fouling, recolonisation and regrowth from the debris created by the cleaner,
whether there were communities resistant to cleaning, and,
the optimum length of brush bristle.
The results showed that the cleaner was mostly ineffective at reducing the blockage of the netting from biofouling and any reduction to be had only occurred at very high levels of fouling. This was determined to be because the brush bristles had limited contact with the net. In addition, there must be a compromise between the severity of scrubbing and the prevention of causing damage to the net. It was also found that the debris caused by cleaning and the survival of macroagal remnants in crevices enabled rapid recolonisation and regrowth of biofouling. This suggests that a successful cleaner would need some method of collecting any debris, as this could also irritate fish gills and disperse potential pathogens. Overall, this study showed the difficulties of in situ net cleaning and provided pointers for future improvements.
Comments
This paper was interesting although I found the explanations of the trials and results found to be rather convoluted and confusing, many times when reading I wished the author would be more clear as to the objective of each trial. I was also puzzled why the introduction makes references to the trouble caused by debris from scrubbing and then proceeded to test a prototype which only scrubbed and concluded that debris removal was needed. It seemed rather a wasted effort when they already appeared to have come to that conclusion in the introduction. Concluding though, the paper does make a good job at introducing some of the difficulties of in situ net cleaning and gives good direction of future improvements. As the paper was written in 1997 it will be interesting to see how the technology has improved since.},

  Review                   = {Summary

Computer vision technologies are being used for inspection tasks in many industries with great success, however, these technologies are not widely used in aquaculture. This is mainly due to the difficulties involved in handling the inspection subjects (the fish), who are very sensitive, stress prone and have a great deal of movement freedom. The sensing technology also has to overcome a challenging environment, where light, visibility and stability are not always controllable and are often far from ideal. This review highlights some advances in the field of computer vision that may prove useful tools for aquaculture, and the author has separated these between five key identification tasks:
Counting.
Size measurement and mass estimation.
Gender identification and quality assessment.
Species and stock identification.
Welfare monitoring.

A recurring problem identified with many of these inspection tasks is to inspect the fish in situ and alive. For different tasks, the author suggests two approaches to this; the first is that there should be more of a focus on advancing underwater stereo imaging of live fish. The other is to change how the fish are handled so as to present them better for image processing, for example, a narrow channel system where the environment could be better controlled.

Comments

This review paper was very well structured, delivering its message in a clear and concise manner. It gives a good introduction to how computer vision can help in inspection tasks in agriculture, but only those which involve the fish directly. However, in the main body of the review it was hard to tell how different methods compared, or actually what quantified a good result or the time saving compared to the labour intensive methods.},
