\section{Wider Goals}
This project aims to be part of wider work towards a prototype robotic platform for inspecting and cleaning nets underwater on commercial fish farms. Specifically, this robotic platform would be able to;
\begin{enumerate}
\item move autonomously about the net,
\item perform net inspection tasks,
\item clean the net of fouling, and
\item monitor fish.
\end{enumerate}
The timescale of this project is insufficient to tackle all of these problems and so the second has been chosen as the main aim of this project, with some brief discussion of the mechanism of movement about the net as such as it impacts upon the main aim.

\section{Aims and Objectives}
As discussed this project will concentrate the performance of net inspection tasks of an underwater net cleaning robotic platform. The three aims of these inspection tasks, and the project objectives for each, are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify damage to the net.
\begin{itemize}
\item Study image processing techniques for locating a net within an underwater image.
\item Design an algorithm for detecting damage to the net.
\end{itemize}
\item Identify and quantify biofouling on the net.
\begin{itemize}
\item Study methods of identifying biofouling. %need to be more specific here
\item Study methods of quantifying biofouling.
\item Create software to identify biofouling within the image, and quantify the magnitude.
\end{itemize}
\item Recognise specific species of biofouling on the net.
\begin{itemize}
\item Study visual differences between types of biofouling, with emphasis on more harmful types.
\item Create software to recognise different species, specifically warning if recognise harmful species.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
All these objectives will be tested against images from fish farms and real net in a tank, where the levels of biofouling and the quality of the water will be varied to test performance.
